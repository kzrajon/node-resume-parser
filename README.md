# node-resume-parser
RESTful Resume Parser and save data through another RESTful API with OAuth 2.0 authentication system. This is a part of our microservice project (jobalart.com). Here we parse resume first then save resume's data to database via other RESTful API. There is some types of scenario, first user/resume uploader maybe a user. second he/she not a user. if he/she is a user and he/she try to upload without login then it just revoke the operation with a notification. If he/she isn't a user then it first register the user then login to get access token then save resume data via resume RESTful API. We use simple-resume-parser open source module to parsing resume. Here i didn't upload dictionary file. please build your dictionary in your own style. feel free to use and modify
